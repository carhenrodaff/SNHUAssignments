	DriverPass is a project revolving around providing courses to students. Users login and they can select between different packages, at which point they can make an appointment, choose a pickup location, etc. For this project, I felt that I was able to communicate the clients thoughts easily, while still providing more information for those developing the software. I made sure to account for DriverPass’s needs along with implementing things I knew would be useful bu they hadnt thought of. Ultimately, their needs were critical to get me started working on the project, otherwise I would’ve been lost.
